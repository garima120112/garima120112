          You have no idea how much you mean to me, I might get mad on days for 
          stupid things 99% of you are not even at fault yet you never raised 
          your voice at me cauz you know how it would affect me, never abused
          cauz you know I don't like it, always cared for me loved me to the fullest
          You have no idea how much you have healed me the part you never broke
          Don't ever think all of this goes unnoticed, and I am sorry for reacting
          in negative ways on stupid things that shouldn't even affect us. 
          I love you Tanish Karkera I really do and I still am gonna tickle you 
          tomorrow I love that more hehe
          Hongi mai teri kaleshi chori jaisi hu yahi hu jhelo ab mujhe humesha ke liye
